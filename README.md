# Reactive Load Box for Guitar Amps

To avoid making the neighbors hate me, I designed and built a reactive load box inspired by commercial solutions like the Universal Audio OX Box and Two Notes Captor X.
This allows my 50W Marshall JMP Plexi to be safely driven at proper output levels while feeding a clean, isolated signal directly into my computer without sacrificing the Marshall feel or tone.

# Resistive vs Reactive 
There are two main types of load boxes on the market for amplifier attenuation attentuation
I decided to go with a reactive load similar to the OX box or Captor X vs a resistive load for a more realistic and dynamic feel and tone. For the reactive load part, I referenced this website for Aiken's reactive speaker load for the basis of the design.
